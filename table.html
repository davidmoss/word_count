            As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
          
            Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.
          
            I thought it was a tragic mistake.
          
            That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.
          
            At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar?
          
            I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.
          
            I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.
          
            I understand the skepticism.
          
            After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
          
            For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.
          
            That's why I'm in this race.
          
            I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity.
          
            I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all.
          
            I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.
          
            And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
          
            I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.
          
            I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race.
          
            A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
          
            Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
          
            And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
          
            I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
          
            And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"
          
            And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
          
            My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
          
            In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled.
          
            And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
          
            So I understand the cynicism.
          
            But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate.
          
            We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
          
            For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.
          
            And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked.
          
            And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
          
            I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
          
            I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
          
            And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.
          
            Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
          
            I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.
          
            But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.
          
            And I think that we face one of those moments today.
          
            I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.
          
            Because I think we've all had enough.
          
            Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
          
            I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
          
            I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
          
            I've had enough of that.
          
            I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
          
            I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
          
            I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
          
            And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
          
            I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
          
            Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
          
            Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.
          
            I think he loves his country.
          
            I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
          
            When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.
          
            and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ?
          
            Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
          
            I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.
          
            And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
          
            And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
          
            Because I think that this is our moment to lead.
          
            The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
          
            A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
          
            I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one.
          
            When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
          
            I did not need sewing either.
          
            I knew how to sew.
          
            I'm trying to go to college.
          
            When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.
          
            I don't need to sew to go to college.
          
            I hoped for something else."
          
            I hoped for something else.
          
            I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too.
          
            And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
          
            I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid.
          
            To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
          
            To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.
          
            I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.
          
            To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.
          
            Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
          
            That's why I stand here tonight.
          
            Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!
          
            I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
          
            And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
          
            And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
          
            These are the Americans that I know.
          
            Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.
          
            I just think he doesn't know.
          
            But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
          
            And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
          
            The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
          
            Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
          
            In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
          
            When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
          
            And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
          
            She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life.
          
            In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
          
            And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
          
            And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.
          
            I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
          
            And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
          
            I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
          
            I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
          
            That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
          
            So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.
          
            Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.
          
            I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
          
            I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families.
          
            The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987.
          
            I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
          
            My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.
          
            And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
          
            I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi.
          
            As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
          
            I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.
          
            To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
          
            I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.
          
            And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.
          
            I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
          
            I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
          
            I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.
          
            I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
          
            I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
          
            And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.
          
            And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
          
            Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
          
            And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
          
            I'll invest in early childhood education.
          
            I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.
          
            And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.
          
            And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
          
            And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
          
            Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
          
            But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
          
            I believe there a number of factors at work.
          
            If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
          
            For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
          
            When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
          
            As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
          
            And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.
          
            As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
          
            I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
          
            I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.
          
            And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
          
            But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.
          
            I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.
          
            And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
          
            These are the policies I will pursue.
          
            And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
          
            But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
          
            I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
          
            And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
          
            I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.
          
            So I've got news for you, John McCain.
          
            I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
          
            Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
          
            I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
          
            I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
          
            I get it.
          
            I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
          
            I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
          
            But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.
          
            I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
          
            Because I've seen it.
          
            Because I've lived it.
          
            I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
          
            I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
          
            And I've seen it in this campaign.
          
            But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.
          
            I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
          
            Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.
          
            It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
          
            I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
          
            As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
          
            Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
          
            I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
          
            I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
          
            It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
          
            But let me tell you how I came to be here.
          
            As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.
          
            I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.
          
            I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.
          
            And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
          
            I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
          
            I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
          
            It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
          
            After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
          
            I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
          
            It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.
          
            It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
          
            I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today.
          
            It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
          
            And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
          
            I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement.
          
            I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
          
            But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
          
            I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
          
            I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.

            And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
          
            And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.
          
            And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
          
            And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
          
            And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
          
            And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
          
            And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"
          
            And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
          
            And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
          
            And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
          
            And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand.
          
            And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked.
          
            And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
          
            And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
          
            And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.
          
            And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security.
          
            And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
          
            And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
          
            And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.
          
            And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
          
            And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
          
            And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
          
            And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.
          
            And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
          
            And it will be dangerous.
          
            And I think that we face one of those moments today.
          
            And we are all mortal.''
          
            And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers.
          
            And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas.
          
            And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
          
            And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
          
            And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
          
            And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
          
            And it's the easiest thing in the world.
          
            And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers.
          
            And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
          
            And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
          
            And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
          
            And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.
          
            And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
          
            And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
          
            And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
          
            And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
          
            And they want to believe again.
          
            And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
          
            And she began to cry.
          
            And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
          
            And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
          
            And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
          
            And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.
          
            And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.
          
            And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
          
            And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
          
            And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ?
          
            And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
          
            And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
          
            And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.
          
            And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.
          
            And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.
          
            And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
          
            And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
          
            And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.
          
            And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
          
            And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.
          
            And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
          
            And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.
          
            And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.
          
            And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
          
            And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
          
            And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
          
            And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
          
            And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.
          
            And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
          
            And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.
          
            And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand.
          
            And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
          
            And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.
          
            And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.
          
            And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
          
            And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.
          
            And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
          
            And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
          
            And that's what we have to restore.
          
            And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
          
            And that's to be expected.
          
            And you know what - it's worked before.
          
            And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
          
            And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
          
            And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
          
            And I've seen it in this campaign.
          
            And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
          
            And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
          
            And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
          
            "And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
          
            And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.
          
            And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.
          
            And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.
          
            And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
          
            And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
          
            And it won't be easy.
          
            And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
          
            And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
          
            And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.

            Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.
          
            We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
          
            Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
          
            Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.
          
            When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
          
            Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
          
            The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.
          
            In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
          
            and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.
          
            But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
          
            Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.
          
            The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.
          
            But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
          
            I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
          
            That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
          
            And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
          
            In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
          
            It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
          
            Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
          
            To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.
          
            I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.
          
            I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
          
            Because people just couldn't pronounce it.
          
            And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
          
            The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
          
            It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
          
            And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.
          
            The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
          
            It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
          
            It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
          
            In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
          
            Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
          
            For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
          
            And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.
          
            But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.
          
            And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
          
            A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.
          
            It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
          
            Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.
          
            One that serves its people and is free from corruption.
          
            The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
          
            We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
          
            And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
          
            Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!
          
            Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
          
            Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
          
            But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
          
            Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
          
            And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
          
            In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
          
            A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.
          
            And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
          
            Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
          
            the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
          
            Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.
          
            In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
          
            The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
          
            How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
          
            If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
          
            In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
          
            Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
          
            The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
          
            I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
          
            And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
          
            do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.

            You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
          
            A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
          
            The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
          
            Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
          
            In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
          
            When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
          
            Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
          
            The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
          
            All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
          
            By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
          
            According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
          
            By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
          
            This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
          
            But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
          
            And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
          
            And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
          
            Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
          
            It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
          
            It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
          
            It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
          
            To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
          
            For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.
          
            to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
          
            His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
          
            And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
          
            For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
          
            Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?
          
            Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
          
            We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
          
            We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
          
            And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.
          
            Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
          
            For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
          
            As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
          
            It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
          
            Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.
          
            You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
          
            So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.
          
            We are a better country than this.
          
            You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
          
            This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
          
            This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
          
            Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.
          
            Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
          
            And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
          
            I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
          
            And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
          
            Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
          
            The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
          
            We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
          
            I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.
          
            and within their own countries.
          
            He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?
          
            We all put our country first.
          
            That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.
          
            if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
          
            We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
          
            And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
          
            I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
          
            These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?
          
            The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
          
            And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
          
            Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
          
            I think he loves his country.
          
            I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
          
            Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.

            Well it's time for them to own their failure.
          
            It's time for us to change America.
          
            America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
          
            This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.
          
            It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
          
            Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
          
            In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.
          
            But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
          
            But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
          
            They fight the fight of our time.
          
            But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
          
            Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.
          
            It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
          
            It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
          
            The time for our party's identity crisis is over.
          
            Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
          
            The time for waiting in Iraq is over.
          
            It is time to change our policy.
          
            It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
          
            And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
          
            The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987.
          
            And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
          
            It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
          
            In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
          
            Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
          
            My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history.
          
            It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
          
            America, now is not the time for small plans.
          
            Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
          
            I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
          
            Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.
          
            Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
          
            But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.
          
            Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's.
          
            Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
          
            And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
          
            I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
          
            Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time.
          
            Our time to make a mark on history.
          
            Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.
          
            That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was.
          
            Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
          
            And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
          
            Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
          
            Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.
          
            Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
          
            They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
          
            In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.
          
            They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
          
            I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.
          
            And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
          
            And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.
          
            They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?
          
            The time for that politics is over.
          
            It's time to turn the page.
          
            The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
          
            But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.
          
            Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
          
            Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
          
            It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
          
            And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.
          
            These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?

            Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
          
            But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.
          
            A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
          
            A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
          
            Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
          
            threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.
          
            The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
          
            The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
          
            “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”
This is now the reality of Iraq.
          
            Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
          
            There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?
          
            And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
          
            Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
          
            What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
          
            But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
          
            I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
          
            The time for waiting in Iraq is over.
          
            It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
          
            namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
          
            There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.
          
            The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
          
            They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq.
          
            I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one.
          
            To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
          
            a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
          
            that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.
          
            The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
          
            Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
          
            This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
          
            The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
          
            For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
          
            By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
          
            As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
          
            In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.
          
            And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
          
            You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
          
            We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
          
            any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq.
          
            In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
          
            And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
          
            I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
          
            The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
          
            So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
          
            We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
          
            Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
          
            That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
          
            A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.
          
            But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
          
            The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
          
            if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
          
            Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.
          
            As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
          
            Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
          
            And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
          
            These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?
          
            The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
          
            I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
          
            Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq.
          
            Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.

            We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev.
          
            We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.
          
            We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
          
            We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
          
            We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?
          
            We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.
          
            We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
          
            We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
          
            We know that there are some things we do better together.
          
            According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
          
            We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
          
            We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.
          
            We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
          
            We know who we are.
          
            "We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried.
          
            We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
          
            We cannot turn back."
          
            We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ?
          
            We all made this journey for a reason.
          
            We cannot walk alone.
          
            We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
          
            We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
          
            We are the party of Kennedy.
          
            We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
          
            We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
          
            We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
          
            We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
          
            We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.
          
            We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
          
            We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.
          
            We need to see more.
          
            We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.
          
            We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
          
            We know the challenges.
          
            We've heard them.
          
            We've talked about them for years.
          
            We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
          
            We are the party of Roosevelt.
          
            We all breathe the same air.
          
            We all cherish our children's future.
          
            We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
          
            We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
          
            We are a better country than this.
          
            We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
          
            We've made some progress already.
          
            We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket.
          
            We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
          
            We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
          
            We'll have to make hard choices.
          
            We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
          
            We all put our country first.
          
            We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
          
            We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
          
            We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
          
            We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
          
            We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
          
            We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
          
            We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases.
          
            We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
          
            We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes.
          
            We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
          
            We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.

            It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
          
            It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.
          
            It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.
          
            It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.
          
            It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
          
            It's a bracing idea.
          
            It's a tempting idea.
          
            It doesn't work.
          
            It ignores our history.
          
            It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together.
          
            It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
          
            It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
          
            It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
          
            It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.
          
            It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
          
            It should help us, not hurt us.
          
            It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
          
            It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
          
            It is time to change our policy.
          
            It is time to give Iraqis their country back.
          
            It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
          
            It's time for us to change America.
          
            It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
          
            It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
          
            It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
          
            It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
          
            It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.
          
            It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
          
            It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
          
            It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
          
            It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength."
          
            It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.

            It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
          
            It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
          
            It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
          
            It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
          
            It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
          
            It cannot wait for other nations to act first.
          
            It will be difficult.
          
            It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.
          
            It is being threatened by corruption.
          
            It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem.
          
            It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society.
          
            It's time to turn the page.
          
            It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg.
          
            It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism.
          
            It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.
          
            It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.
          
            It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.
          
            It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.
          
            It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
          
            It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening.
          
            It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
          
            It's not because John McCain doesn't care.
          
            It's because John McCain doesn't get it.
          
            It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.

            The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
          
            The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
          
            The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
          
            The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.

            The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
          
            The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.
          
            The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.
          
            The time for waiting in Iraq is over.
          
            The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.

            The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot.
          
            The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
          
            The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
          
            The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?
          
            The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
          
            The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.
          
            The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.
          
            The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
          
            The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
          
            The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
          
            The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
          
            The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
          
            The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
          
            The security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
          
            The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
          
            The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
          
            The time for that politics is over.
          
            The world has changed.
          
            The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
          
            The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
          
            The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
          
            The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
          
            The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
          
            The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
          
            The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
          
            The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
          
            The good news is that there are already signs of progress here.
          
            The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ?
          
            The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
          
            The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
          
            The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
          
            The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
          
            The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.
          
            The market will fix it.
          
            The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
          
            The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.

            As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.
          
            In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
          
            Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
          
            Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.
          
            But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
          
            Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
          
            The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
          
            I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.
          
            Americans know this.
          
            We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
          
            But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.
          
            We know that there are some things we do better together.
          
            We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
          
            And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.
          
            It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
          
            I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
          
            Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.
          
            I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
          
            As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
          
            We know who we are.
          
            I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
          
            And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
          
            I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
          
            It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
          
            As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.
          
            It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
          
            Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
          
            We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
          
            And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.
          
            I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
          
            But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
          
            All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
          
            We know the challenges.
          
            She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.
          
            And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
          
            No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
          
            I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
          
            And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
          
            We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
          
            I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
          
            You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.
          
            I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.
          
            I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
          
            These are the Americans that I know.
          
            Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
          
            I just think he doesn't know.
          
            I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
          
            And you know what - it's worked before.
          
            You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building.
          
            We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
          
            And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
          
            If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
          
            We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
          
            And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
